		<p>I suppose you're curious as to why this site would even exist, what's it function, and why you would care? Oh, no? Well, I'm still going to explain all of that stuff any way. It started because I missed the cartoons of my childhood. Nostalgia inspires us to do some funny things. I like to think of this as slowly building catalog or library. I plan on filling it with a bunch of varying cartoons from my personal childhood but it isn't only about me. I also want you as users to engage with me and this site. Send me some of your favorite childhood cartoons and I will also list and feature them on the site with their own entries. If you can't remember the name of something that sparked your interest as a kid submit the description to us down in the <a href="contactus.html"> Contact Us</a> section of our site. Stay tuned for more updates and additions! <br><br> <i>P.S. Don't let people tell you, "You're too old to think about cartoons." Those people are probably dead inside.</i> </p>
